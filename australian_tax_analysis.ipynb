    "## 📈 Key Findings & Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Employees:\n",
    "1. **Tax-free Threshold**: Income up to $18,200 is not taxed\n",
    "2. **Progressive System**: Higher earners pay proportionally more tax\n",
    "3. **Withholding Refunds**: The conservative withholding system typically results in year-end refunds\n",
    "4. **Superannuation**: Pre-tax super contributions reduce taxable income\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Employers:\n",
    "1. **Compliance**: Must withhold correct amounts based on ATO schedules\n",
    "2. **Super Guarantee**: Mandatory 11% contribution to employee super funds\n",
    "3. **Competitive Advantage**: Attractive super arrangements can help recruit talent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Planning:\n",
    "1. Salary sacrifice to super reduces taxable income\n",
    "2. Understanding effective tax rates helps with financial planning\n",
    "3. Tax refunds can be minimized by adjusting withholding if desired"
