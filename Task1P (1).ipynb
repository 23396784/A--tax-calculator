    "# Task Overview: Income tax serves as the preliminary source of revenue for the Australian Government, collected and managed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). \n",
    "# This tax is levied on the taxable income of individuals and deducted at the source by employers through a weekly withholding tax system.\n",
    "# Employers pay the withheld amounts directly to the ATO to ensure compliance with income tax regulations.\n",
    "# After the financial year, individuals must lodge a tax return to determine their actual tax liability.\n",
    "# Often, the withholding tax paid throughout the year exceeds the exact liability, resulting in a refund. \n",
    "# This system facilitates timely revenue collection and allows taxpayers to reconcile their tax payments and claim excess deductions.\n",
    "# This notebook is designed to demonstrate a real-life application of computing taxable income, weekly withholding tax, and annual income tax. \n",
    "# It also discusses the possibility of tax refunds depending on an individual’s total revenue and superannuation contributions. \n",
    "# Through this taxation workflow, the notebook provides a detailed insight into the Australian income tax system, which is helpful for the financial management of working-class employees."
